All the code is written in C#

Tasks for grabs:
- Perfect evolution algortihm for training snakes
- Build level progressions system (maybe even level editor if there is time)
- Implement wall obstacle logic
- Level completion item
- Info window for all items
- Places where snake can go through its body
- Settings where user can set above mentioned controls
- Battling agains AI snake
- Set predefined number of pauses for game
- Set predefined number of lives for game

Done so far: 
- basic evolution algorithm for training snakes (needs to be perfected)
- simple gameplay for snake game (this could be granulated but you get the feeling for what that means; just checkout this commit - 1a46ab1640afa7e03abcadfd7ead92ba8922a215)
- Moving snake by multiple fields (arrow + num key)
- Moving snake to edge of board (arrow + shift key)
- Moving snake to edge of its body (arrow + ctrl)
- Snake length modifier item
- Snake direction modifier item
- Reverse controls item
- Points pick up items (give you both positive/negative points)
